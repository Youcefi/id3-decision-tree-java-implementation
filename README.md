# ID3 Decision Tree Java Implementation
This project is a Java implementation of the ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) algorithm for decision tree learning. The ID3 algorithm is a popular approach for building decision trees from labeled training data.


The ID3 algorithm uses entropy and information gain measures to determine the best attribute for splitting the data at each node of the decision tree. It recursively builds the tree by selecting the attribute with the highest information gain, creating a new node for that attribute, and splitting the data based on the attribute's values.
